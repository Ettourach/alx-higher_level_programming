An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code. In this project, I linked two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, I used the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and executed my SQL queries.

In the second part, I used the module SQLAlchemy, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
